###Editor Color Codes
These are the color codes you can use when posting messages, sending feedback and email on WWIV BBS. To use
a particular color type CTRL-P + the letter or number that represents the color you want. You can then use 
CTRL-P+0 to return to the default color.

###WWIV Pipe Colors

### Notes
Just some notes to use when working on this page

* Put the stuff about the colors in here.
* Should mention anything that doesn't work like on Local Server

From What's New
```
* Added 2 new pipe codes:
  * |#<wwiv color code 0-9> as an alternative to the "heart" codes
  * |@<macro character> as an alternative to ^O^O<macro char>
  * Existing pipe codes are: |B<background char>, and |<2 digit code>
    for foreground colors. (Build36)
