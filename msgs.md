# Customize MSGs to Users
***
When you logged in, you saw several places where some placeholder messages were displayed. 
These messages are all specified in files located at \wwiv\gfiles. In this directory, there 
are a number of .MSG and .ANS files which are the messages and menus displayed you users as 
they use your WWIV 5.0 BBS.

You can customize all of these as you wish. They can be edited with NOTEPAD or another text 
editor. .MSG files are used by default and .ANS files are displayed to users if their client 
supports ANSI.
