## What's a WWIVNet?
WWIVNet refers to a WWIV BBS based Net that uses WWIV's message and network 
packet system to share email and sub messages. There are and have been other 
WWIVNet based networks, similiar to how there are more than one FidoNet 
Technology based net. All of these nets are covered on the [Other Nets](othernets) page.

For the purpose of this page, WWIVNet refers to the specific instance of a 
WWIVNet that is the primary network for WWIV BBSes called WWIVNet.

## Technical Overview of WWIVNet

Currently WWIVnet uses a centralized SMTP and POP server to route email and sub messages to member nodes. This will be replaced with a BINKP based solution in the future.

## Hosting your own WWIVNet SUB

If\when you are are ready to host your own WWIVNet sub here are the steps to take:

* Set up your sub locally in your BBS first. This is harmless.
* Get to the Sub Editor in //SYSOP or from the WFC screen.
* Choose to Insert a new SUB and fill-out the Name, and Filename fields at a minimum.
* Then choose "J" Net Info and select WWIVNet
* The SUBTYPE is the internal name of the sub in WWIVNet this must be unique (see SUBS.LST)
* Select YES you will be hosting the SUB.
* It is easiest and best to also allow auto add/drop requests. Unless your Sub is more exclusive.
* Select YES to add it to SUBS.LST to make it public.  
**Note:** Currently we have to manually share the subs.lst, that will be fixed in the future.
* Add your Sub to the subs.lst or request help on the WWIV Sysops Sub
* Post an announcement on the WWIVNet Sub Yellow Pages to advertise your new sub
