## WWIVnet Application for Membership

WWIVnet is a mail network for WWIV, and compatible bulletin board
systems. If you would like to join, please fill out this application.
When you've completed it, you must rename it to <last_name>.APP. This is
to prevent it from being looked over or overwritten by another application.

The best way to have your application processed is to get on a WWIVnet
BBS and mail this completed application to either the WWIVnet Network 
Coordinator, Eli Sanford 1@1 WWIVnet or email elisanford@gmail.com
