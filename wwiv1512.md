                                By Rushfan 1@514

                                Main Themes
                                ~~~~~~~~~~~
    Messages and WWIVNet have always been at the heart of WWIV. For 5.1, I 
    plan on modernizing and improving the internal code quality of the 
    messaging code, making it easier to embed into new tools. Included in 
    this will be support for the JAM Message Base format to broaden the 
    range of tools available for exposing message bases.
    
    More on JAM: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAM_Message_Base_Format

    Net38 will be finalized [currently Beta 6] and released supporting any 
    new changes to get WWIVNet functioning in the Internet era.
