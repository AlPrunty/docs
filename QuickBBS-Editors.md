## QuickBBS Based Full Screen Editors
WWIV does include support for editors such as **OpenEdit** and **Tide**. Bringing you more choices for you and your users to write messages on your system.

I include information on how to set them up in **INIT**.
In INIT the steps are, type or scroll to E for **External Editor Configuration**.
