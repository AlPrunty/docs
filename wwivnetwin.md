# Configuring WWIVNet on Windows
***

## Overview

1. Get [WWIVNET.zip](http://wwivbbs.com/wwivnet/)
2. Get Net38b.zip **NOTE:** As part of the WWIV 5.0 Update this is not yet available.

## Installation & Configuration
Within the Net37.zip there are two documents and I've also posted them on the wiki:  

* [NET37.DOC](net37doc) <- Has all the installation information (Must Read!)
* [NET37TEC.DOC](net37tecdoc) <- Good technical read on the inner workings of WWIVNet (optional)
