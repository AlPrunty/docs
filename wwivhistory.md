# History of WWIV
***

Wayne Bell originally wrote WWIV BBS software and developed it until 1997.  In 1998, WWIV was purchased by WWIV Software Services, LLC (WSS) and was supported, developed and distributed by WSS and authorized Source Distribution Sites (SDS) until XXXX. In YYYY WSS agreed to open source the WWIV Software under the Apache License. It is the BBS system of choice for thousands of sysops world-wide who appreciate having a rock-solid BBS system to rely upon and who like the fact that it is dynamic and evolving software.

TODO: This needs to be updated to WWIV 5.0 history

WWIV was originally written by Wayne
Bell.  Wayne began work on WWIV when he was a teenager.  It
was first written in BASIC on a TRS-80.  Wayne soon
recognized the limitations of the BASIC language for BBS
operations and he re-wrote the program in PASCAL.  At that
time, the BBS could be registered by donations of $25.  The
last PASCAL version was v3.21d. Many modern day PASCAL BBS
systems are based wholly or in part upon this early version
of WWIV. All v4.xx releases of WWIV have been written in C.
With this language, WWIV has developed into a multifeatured
BBS system supporting one of the most trouble-free hobbyist
networks in the world.  WWIVnet, the network founded by
Wayne, began as a local based network in Los Angeles,
California with 25 charter members.  In the early 1990's,
the network grew to over 1,500 members located around the
world. Because many sysops wanted to run their own networks
for various reasons, Wayne added a feature which allowed the
BBS system to participate in multiple WWIV-based networks
and developed the networking software to support such
multiple network usage. At the peak, there were some 100
WWIV based networks offering a range of topics and
supporting a multitude of various interests.

In January of 1998, Dean Nash purchased WWIV and WWIV
Software Services from Wayne Bell.  WSS was reformed as
a Tennessee Limited Liability Company with a full
corporate posture. Craig Dooley was appointed Support
Coordinator and supervises the Support Board System and
Source Distribution Sites.

The documentation for WWIV has also developed overtime.
It began as a short 3-page document written by Wayne.
Later, with v4.10, William Daystrom wrote a complete
set of documentation for use with WWIV. Beginning with
v4.20, Filo added additional comments to some of the
documentation files written by Will and completely
rewrote others.  The documentation was again completely
rewritten by Filo for v4.23 and updated for the v4.24a
release. With the release of v4.30, the documentation
was updated to reflect all code changes and was
converted to several different formats for your
convenience.
