## New Installations

steps, see the full details on related INIT settings, WWIV.INI and other Advanced 
configuration topics.

## [Upgrading Earlier WWIV BBSes](wwivupgrade)
Do you have your floppy disks with your 4.x WWIV BBS on it? We can get you upgraded to WWIV 5.0 
and you can join the fold again!

## [Init Settings](Configuration/init)
## User Access Protocols for WWIV 5.0  
BBSes used to only be accessible by dialing them up on your phone line with a MODEM. When 
the internet took off many BBSes added Telnet support to allow users to connect to the BBS
over the internet. That is still in use today. These pages explain how to use the WWIV 5.0 
builtin Telnet Server and Net2BBS from PCMicro.

The email system in WWIV allows the sending of email to other users on the system as well as other users in WWIV based networks you participate in and even to Internet users if you have the appropriate add on software installed. Sending email is as easy as hitting the E key at the WFC or online.  You can email a local user by name or number.  For sending WWIV based network mail, see the network documentation for addressing.
