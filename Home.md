## User Access Protocols for WWIV 5.0  
BBSes used to only be accessible by dialing them up on your phone line with a MODEM. When 
the internet took off many BBSes added Telnet support to allow users to connect to the BBS
over the internet. That is still in use today. These pages explain how to use the WWIV 5.0 
builtin Telnet Server and Net2BBS from PCMicro.
