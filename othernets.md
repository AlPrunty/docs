# Other Nets
***
A Net is a federation of BBSes which share content in Subs so messages or files posted on 
one BBS are replicated to the others. 

There are WWIVNet based Nets and FidoNet based nets. For the purpose of this this page that 
refers not the instances of the Nets themselves (which can the same names), but to the 
underlying technology they use and the many instances of Nets that use those formats. (Yeah, 
it's a little confusing). :-)

## WWIVNet Based Networks
### [WWIVNet](wwivnet)
### FileNet


## Fido Technology Nets (FTN)
This covers Nets based on the FidoNet standards

### Tools to connect WWIV to FTNs
#### WWIVTOSS
