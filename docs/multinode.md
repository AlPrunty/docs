# Running Multiple Instances of NODES of WWIV 5.0
***

When you run a multi-node BBS it means several users can access your BBS at the same time.
This will cover information on setting that up, ways you can use it to your advantage and 
impacts it may have on other parts of your BBS.

## Dedicated NODE for WWWIVNet Connectivity
You can dedicate a node for connecting to [WWIVNet](WWIVNet) (or [OtherNets](Other_Nets)) so your BBS can connect and 
share files without taking the system down to users.

## Impact on Doors
When you run multiple instances, your Doors need to be setup to run an instance for each node 
that you use to grant access to users. You don't need to configure your games for Nodes that 
you use for WWIVNet connectivity or other connectivity related tasks. When you read the 
instructions on setting up [Doors](doors) it explains what you do to set that up.
