Ideas for new utilities or new features for WWIV that might take more time than usual.

1. A new WWIVEdit, probably written in C++. :)
2. Storage Type other than 2 with refactoring of Message objects to be more abstracted.
3. Embedding a scripting language (Python, JavaScript) in the BBS.
4. Built-in FTN support.
5. Built-in QWKnet support.
6. Add secure protocol to WWIVTelnet Server. SSH?
7. Add GEOIP filter/block tools to WWIVTelnet Server
8. Autosend (external or built-in to network tools)
