# WWIV Chains \ Doors
***

## Guidelines
If you are going to add a door and installation instructions, please include a link to 
the official source of the game of the game. If the company no longer exists, please 
direct everyone to a WWIVNet Node and Transfer Sub where it can be located.

## Compatible Doors
These doors are known to work on WWIV 5.0 because one of the SysOps is running them. We'll provide linkes and installation instructions to get you going.
